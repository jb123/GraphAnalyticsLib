# GraphAnalyticsLib
First ever - A Graph Analytics Library providing the user with an In-Memory Graph and Graph Analytics Algorithms for analysis, <b>purely</b> written in Javascript, using Javascript's parallel computing capabilities, without any external dependencies.


# Features
- Can be used anywhere Javascript can be executed
- Can be used in React and React Native thus allowing graph creation, processing and analytics on mobile platforms,IoT as well as browsers or Node.js based frameworks.
- Supports Multi-graphs
- Allows creation,storing, managing,processing and analyzing graphs/multi-graphs using only JS without external dependencies.
- Provides in-built Graph Analytical Algorithms to process and analyze graphs.
- Graph Analytics Algorithms use JavaScript's parallel computing capabilities for optimized execution (In progress)

# Sample Usage
