# GraphAnalyticsLib
First ever - A Graph Anlaytics Library providing the user with an in-memory graph and graph analytics algorithms enabling the user to create, store, manage, process and most importantly analyze graphs for insights and other purposes, <b>purely</b> written in Javascript without any external dependencies.



# Usage
- Can be used anywhere javascript can be executed
- Can be used in React, React Native, browsers, Iot platforms, mobile platforms and other JS based frameworks/libraries (Node.js etc)
- Allows creation,storing, managing,processing and analyzing graphs using only JS without external dependencies.
- Provides in-built graph analytical algorithms to process and analyze graphs



# To Do / In Progress
- Library is still in progress - need to generalize "cost" attributes in relationship
- Increasing efficiency / optimization by parallel computing of algorithms
- Better formatting
- Adding support for NPM
- Packaging of the library
- Performing performance benchmarks
- Adding other algorithms
